# alphasign

This is a fork of the original [msparks project](https://github.com/msparks/alphasign). It has not been modified in any meaningful way other than to make it work on Python 3 and some minor code formatting issues.

## About
alphasign is a Python library for
[Alpha American](http://www.alpha-american.com/) LED signs, such as the
[Betabrite](http://www.betabrite.com/). It implements the
[Alpha Communications Protocol](http://www.alpha-american.com/p-alpha-communications-protocol.html).
